Meta-U Capstone Project 

General Themes: 
 - Productivity/Professional services, social work, Finance, entertainment. 

Problem Statement: Not being able to win in poker: 

Ideas:   

- **Poker tool for analysis**: essentially takes in data from different sites from specific players, allows users to play against them in real time, based on tendencies and analysis. Could be complicated and not neccesarily applicable, but good solo training tool

Problem Statment: I don't know what I could make with these ingredients

- **App For Meta Rayband**: Not exaclty and Idea or webapp but something that could take advantage of the glasses would be really intriguiging to me. Possibly using video and the meta office map to reccommend people that are often in the same areas as you but yet you do not interact. Maybe this could instead rely on location and could recommend friends/co-workers. This could be used for the problem above, maybe you snap a picture and then get ideas for what to make with the ingredients.

Problem Statement: 

- **Song Editor** I mentioned this idea earlier that I tried to do with a friend, but was not neccesarily able to get anywhere with it. Now with the addition of so many new tools in AI, I might want to create an application that takes in audio files and user-inputted base-drops to create remixes, add funny videos (using some AI tools). This sort of already exists whidch might be the issue.

Education App: 

- **Interview prep app**: App that can act as an interview/learning tool. Essentially would start as IB practice as lots of questions of the type exist, could use chatgpt to generate questions, and then format them into nice looking quizzes. Could also be a social media tool, so features could include

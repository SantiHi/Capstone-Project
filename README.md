Meta-U Capstone Project 


Ideas:   

- **Poker tool for analysis**: essentially takes in data from different sites from specific players, allows users to play against them in real time, based on tendencies and analysis. Could be complicated and not neccesarily applicable, but good solo training tool \\

- **Visual Aid For Meta Rayband**: Not exaclty and Idea or webapp but something that could take advantage of the glasses would be really intriguiging to me. Possibly using video and the meta office map to reccommend people that are often in the same areas as you but yet you do not interact. Maybe this could instead rely on location and could recommend friends/co-workers.
